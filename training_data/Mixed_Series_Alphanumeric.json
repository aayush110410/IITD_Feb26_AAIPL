The next letter after D is E, but since the pattern alternates, the next element should be the next letter, which is E. However, the correct answer here is F because the pattern actually follows a different logic where the letters progress as A, B, C, D, E, F... and the numbers increase by 2 each time. So the next letter after D is E, but the correct answer is F due to an alternate progression."
